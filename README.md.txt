For "Implement Your Own Creation" game, we have built a small game based on "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". The game sequence occurs in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is a fictional British boarding school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling. This game includes 5 locations inside Hogwards and some magical objects that you'll interact with. Potterheads (fans of Harry Potter) will thoroughly enjoy this game. 

Being Potterheads, we thought it would be fun to build a test-based game on this since this was one of the popular fantasy worlds we knew well. We thoroughly enjoyed building this game and hope the players will have fun playing it!
